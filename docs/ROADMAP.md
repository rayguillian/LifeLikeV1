## 5. Backend Streamlining & Efficiency

### Goals
- Improve modularity and reduce tight coupling between AI agents and services.
- Enhance system stability and predictability.
- Optimize performance for core backend processes.

### Key Initiatives
- **Refactor AI Agent Communication**: Define clear interfaces and reduce direct dependencies between agents. Centralize interactions through `AIController` where appropriate.
- **State Management Review**: Ensure consistent and predictable state updates across all backend modules. Evaluate `worldState` for potential simplifications and ensure a single source of truth for shared state.
- **API Definition for Core Services**: Formalize APIs for `LLMService`, `NarrativeMemory`, `ConsequenceEngine`, etc., to improve modularity and testability.
- **Backend Test Coverage Expansion**: Increase unit and integration tests for critical backend logic, especially for agent interactions, state mutations, and error pathways.
- **Performance Profiling and Optimization**: Systematically identify and address bottlenecks in AI agent processing, LLM calls, and the world simulation loop. Implement caching strategies where beneficial.
- **Error Handling and Resilience**: Improve error handling mechanisms in backend services to prevent cascading failures and provide clearer diagnostic information.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralize and simplify configuration for AI agents and services.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging for better traceability and implement comprehensive monitoring for system health and performance.

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- Isolated test world
